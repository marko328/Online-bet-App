Due to COVID 19 lockdowns, many bookmakers switching to online business. According to that, i've decided to make an online bet app, only the client part of cource,
so if you guys are a betting fans this will be a great news for you.
JavaScript funcionalities allowed me to create errors in the betting process. App was made in serbian language so i will give you a few hints: "Opklada je polozena"
means "The bet is on", "Unesite sifru utakmice" means "Enter the number of your bet", "Uneti podatak nije broj" means "Its not a number", "Sifra ne postoji" means "The 
number of match does not exist(less than/greater than)" and "Sifra vase opklade je uneta" means that you entered the number of the game successfully. 
 As you can see, Sifra utakmice refers to a number of the game you r' betting on, and Opklada button refers to a bet itself. Thanks to switch statement in JS we can be informed 
 if our bet is on or not. With a catch err a made a custom errors which may occur(correct me if i'am wrong).
 Idea was only originally mine and i think there are no similar online bet apps on the Web. I hope you like it.
